# ü¶ø Legged Robotics in Genesis

A [legged_gym](https://github.com/leggedrobotics/legged_gym) based framework for training legged robots in [Genesis](https://github.com/Genesis-Embodied-AI/Genesis/tree/main) and [IsaacGym](https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac-gym)

## üåü Features

- **Totally based on [legged_gym](https://github.com/leggedrobotics/legged_gym)**

- **Integration of 2 simulators: Genesis and IsaacGym**
  
  You can train policies in two simulators using one framework and two conda environments.

- **Incorporation of various methods in published RL papers**
