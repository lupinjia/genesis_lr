## Introduction

genesis_lr is a training framework for robot control based on RL (Reinforcement Learning). It's based on [legged_gym](https://github.com/leggedrobotics/legged_gym) and [rsl_rl](https://github.com/leggedrobotics/rsl_rl) from RSL_RL. 

## Features

- **Integration of IsaacGym and Genesis** in one framework. You only need to create two conda environments to use different simulator.
- **Incoporation of various published papers of RL**. We implemented various methods published in papers and provided material to compare and differentiate them.
